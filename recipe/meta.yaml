  summary: Statistical downscaling and postprocessing models for climate and weather model simulations.
  description: |
    Scikit-downscale is a toolkit for statistical downscaling usising Xarray. It is meant to
    support the development of new and existing downscaling methods in a common framework. It
    implements a fit/predict API that accepts Xarray objects, similiar to Pythonâ€™s Scikit-Learn,
    for building a wide range of statitical downscaling models.
